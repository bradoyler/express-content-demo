The officer gave chase and &quot;physical altercation&quot; occurred between the officer and a suspect, who was described as aged 18 and black. Dotson said the suspect then &quot;fired at least three rounds at the police officer&quot; before he returned fire. The officer was unharmed. Dotson said a 9mm Ruger was recovered at the scene. &quot;An investigation will decide if the officer's behavior was appropriate,&quot; the police chief added. Angry crowds gathered in the aftermath of the incident and Dotson said several police cars were damaged during the demonstrations. Some people shouted &quot;Hands up, don't shoot&quot; in reference to the fatal shooting of Brown by a white police officer, which led to weeks of sometimes violent unrest. Officer Darren Wilson has not been charged in Brown's death. Ferguson is about 16 miles from the scene of the Wednesday's shooting."

Many experts say the passengers would have died in the explosive decompression that followed the impact of the missile blamed for bringing the Boeing 777 down over Ukraine. But Timmermans told TV host Jeroen Pauw: &quot;Do you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask on their mouth — and so they had the time to put it on?&quot; In his apology, Timmermans clarified that the mask was found around the neck of the passenger, an Australian, rather than their mouth. The crash site was left unsecured for weeks and was allegedly tampered with by Russian rebels."

The officer gave chase and &quot;physical altercation&quot; occurred between the officer and a suspect, who was described as aged 18 and black. Dotson said the suspect then &quot;fired at least three rounds at the police officer&quot; before he returned fire. The officer was unharmed. Dotson said a 9mm Ruger was recovered at the scene. &quot;An investigation will decide if the officer's behavior was appropriate,&quot; the police chief added. Angry crowds gathered in the aftermath of the incident and Dotson said several police cars were damaged during the demonstrations. Some people shouted &quot;Hands up, don't shoot&quot; in reference to the fatal shooting of Brown by a white police officer, which led to weeks of sometimes violent unrest. Officer Darren Wilson has not been charged in Brown's death. Ferguson is about 16 miles from the scene of the Wednesday's shooting."

Many experts say the passengers would have died in the explosive decompression that followed the impact of the missile blamed for bringing the Boeing 777 down over Ukraine. But Timmermans told TV host Jeroen Pauw: &quot;Do you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask on their mouth — and so they had the time to put it on?&quot; In his apology, Timmermans clarified that the mask was found around the neck of the passenger, an Australian, rather than their mouth.

Officials said a large group of men, some dressed in police uniforms, and carrying assault rifles, stopped a convoy of cars. They dragged four women out of the cars in the middle of the night and raped them in a field near the main road. The assault provoked such an outpouring of rage that former President Hamid Karzai told a delegation of women the perpetrators would face the death penalty. Karzai confirmed the death sentences just before leaving office late last month."

            "bio": "<p>Brian Williams is seen by more U.S. television viewers on a daily basis than any other individual. Since taking over as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News in 2004, he has strengthened the broadcast's position as the most-watched newscast in all of television and has become the most highly decorated evening news anchor of the modern era. He has received eleven Edward R. Murrow Awards, twelve Emmy Awards, the duPont-Columbia University Award, the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism and the industry’s highest honor, the George Foster Peabody Award.</p><p>Williams began his broadcasting career in 1981 at KOAM-TV in Pittsburg, Kan. He worked at several local stations in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City before joining NBC News in 1993. He became NBC’s chief White House correspondent and then anchor and managing editor of \"The News With Brian Williams\" on MSNBC and CNBC. </p><p>In 2004, he took over as anchor of \"NBC Nightly News,\" the nation’s top-rated nightly news program, a distinction it has maintained throughout Williams’ tenure in the anchor chair. Two years later, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. </p><p>In 2011, NBC News launched \"Rock Center with Brian Williams,\" the network’s first new primetime newsmagazine in nearly two decades. </p><p>Williams’ coverage of world events has earned him high praise and several citations for journalistic excellence, many of which were awarded for his work covering Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. The New York Tims said his reporting of Katrina was “a defining moment,” and Vanity Fair later called his work “Murrow-worthy” and reported that during the crisis he became “a nation’s anchor.” He has covered numerous presidential campaigns, nominating conventions, and elections, and has moderated eight presidential debates. </p><p>Williams is a native of Middletown, N.J. where he was a firefighter for several years. Before his start in broadcasting, Williams worked in the White House during the Carter administration, beginning as an intern. He later worked as assistant administrator of the political action committee of the National Association of Broadcasters in Washington. He attended Brookdale Community College, Catholic University and George Washington University, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation.</p>",

Since taking over as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News in 2004, he has strengthened the broadcast's position as the most-watched newscast in all of television and has become the most highly decorated evening news anchor of the modern era. He has received eleven Edward R. Murrow Awards, twelve Emmy Awards, the duPont-Columbia University Award, the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism and the industry’s highest honor, the George Foster Peabody Award.</p><p>Williams began his broadcasting career in 1981 at KOAM-TV in Pittsburg, Kan. He worked at several local stations in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City before joining NBC News in 1993. He became NBC’s chief White House correspondent and then anchor and managing editor of \"The News With Brian Williams\" on MSNBC and CNBC. </p><p>In 2004, he took over as anchor of \"NBC Nightly News,\" the nation’s top-rated nightly news program, a distinction it has maintained throughout Williams’ tenure in the anchor chair. Two years later, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. </p><p>In 2011, NBC News launched \"Rock Center with Brian Williams,\" the network’s first new primetime newsmagazine in nearly two decades. </p><p>Williams’ coverage of world events has earned him high praise and several citations for journalistic excellence, many of which were awarded for his work covering Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. The New York Tims said his reporting of Katrina was “a defining moment,” and Vanity Fair later called his work “Murrow-worthy” and reported that during the crisis he became “a nation’s anchor.” He has covered numerous presidential campaigns, nominating conventions, and elections, and has moderated eight presidential debates. </p><p>Williams is a native of Middletown, N.J. where he was a firefighter for several years. Before his start in broadcasting, Williams worked in the White House during the Carter administration, beginning as an intern. He later worked as assistant administrator of the political action committee of the National Association of Broadcasters in Washington. He attended Brookdale Community College, Catholic University and George Washington University, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation.</p>",

In this role, she also serves as a fill-in anchor for \"Nightly News with Brian Williams\" and the \"TODAY\" show. Prior to being named national correspondent, Snow served as correspondent for \"Rock Center with Brian Williams\".</p><p>Over her career, Snow has covered politics, four presidential elections, the White House and Congress. She continues to cover breaking news stories -- from the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., to the mall attack in Kenya and the oil spill in the Gulf. </p><p>An Emmy-winning journalist, Snow has traveled extensively and told stories that created change. Her Rock Center piece on teenage foreign exchange students being abused by host parents led to new policies at the State Department. Snow’s investigative reports on texting while driving and soccer concussions among young female soccer players sparked national conversations.  She was the first reporter to sit down with one of the victims in the Jerry Sandusky scandal and tell his story, as well as the first to speak with kidnap victim Hannah Anderson.</p><p>Snow has interviewed a wide range of newsmakers -- from President Obama to Bono. She pointedly questioned President Bill Clinton in his first interview after his wife lost the 2008 nomination. But she can just as easily sing a tune with Rick Springfield.</p><p>Prior to joining NBC News as a \"Dateline\" correspondent in 2010, Snow was the anchor of the weekend edition of Good Morning America, a program she anchored from its inception. Previously, she was a White House correspondent for ABC News and a Congressional Correspondent for CNN.</p><p>Snow is a graduate of Cornell University and holds a master’s degree in international affairs from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. She serves on the national board of the charity Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. Snow and her husband have two children.</p>",

In 2013, he was the most-used correspondent on any broadcast network evening news program.  His portfolio of beats includes transportation, consumer and regulatory issues, NASA, business and economics.</p><p>Since 2005, Costello has been NBC’s lead aviation correspondent.  Among the major aviation stories he’s covered:  the crash of Asiana flight 214 in San Francisco; Air France 447 over the Atlantic; Colgan Air flight 3407 in Buffalo; Comair 5191 in Lexington; and the Miracle on the Hudson landing in 2009 for which NBC News was honored with a prestigious Sigma Delta Chi Award and a National Emmy Award for Breaking News Coverage. </p><p>In 2008, Costello led NBC's Emmy award-winning coverage of the Financial Bailout Talks in Congress.  But he insists his favorite stories involve ordinary people living extraordinary lives. </p><p>Former NBC Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert brought Costello to the DC bureau in 2005.  Previously, he was based at NBC News headquarters in New York. </p><p>From 1996 to 2004, Costello worked at CNBC Business News.  He was on duty as CNBC’s Nasdaq Correspondent in Manhattan when terrorists attacked on 9/11.  From 1996-1999, he reported from London for both CNBC and NBC News, covering Europe's monetary union, the financial markets and the death of Princess Diana, among his many stories.</p><p>His assignments have taken him around the world -- from the terrorist bombings in Madrid, to the Korean DMZ, the Persian Gulf, Russia, Kazakhstan, Japan, Central America, Eastern and Western Europe. </p><p>Before joining CNBC, Costello contributed to Financial Times TV and CNN in Brussels, Belgium while also earning a master's degree.  He spent six years at KUSA-TV in Denver, and two years at KVIA-TV in El Paso, TX.  He’s honored to have been on the teams that have won National and Regional Emmys, a DuPont-Columbia Journalism Award, Edward R. Murrow honors, Sigma Delta Chi Awards, National Headliner honors, Best of Gannett, and Best Reporting honors from the Associated Press.</p><p>Costello holds a bachelor's degree in Broadcast Journalism from the University of Colorado at Boulder, and a master's degree in Administration/International Commerce from Boston University’s Brussels Graduate Center.  He is married to Astrid Boon of Kortenberg, Belgium, and has two children.</p>",

Since taking over as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News in 2004, he has strengthened the broadcast's position as the most-watched newscast in all of television and has become the most highly decorated evening news anchor of the modern era. He has received eleven Edward R. Murrow Awards, twelve Emmy Awards, the duPont-Columbia University Award, the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism and the industry’s highest honor, the George Foster Peabody Award.</p><p>Williams began his broadcasting career in 1981 at KOAM-TV in Pittsburg, Kan. He worked at several local stations in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City before joining NBC News in 1993. He became NBC’s chief White House correspondent and then anchor and managing editor of \"The News With Brian Williams\" on MSNBC and CNBC. </p><p>In 2004, he took over as anchor of \"NBC Nightly News,\" the nation’s top-rated nightly news program, a distinction it has maintained throughout Williams’ tenure in the anchor chair. Two years later, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. </p><p>In 2011, NBC News launched \"Rock Center with Brian Williams,\" the network’s first new primetime newsmagazine in nearly two decades. </p><p>Williams’ coverage of world events has earned him high praise and several citations for journalistic excellence, many of which were awarded for his work covering Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. The New York Tims said his reporting of Katrina was “a defining moment,” and Vanity Fair later called his work “Murrow-worthy” and reported that during the crisis he became “a nation’s anchor.” He has covered numerous presidential campaigns, nominating conventions, and elections, and has moderated eight presidential debates. </p><p>Williams is a native of Middletown, N.J. where he was a firefighter for several years. Before his start in broadcasting, Williams worked in the White House during the Carter administration, beginning as an intern. He later worked as assistant administrator of the political action committee of the National Association of Broadcasters in Washington. He attended Brookdale Community College, Catholic University and George Washington University, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation.</p>",

            "bio": "<p>Brian Williams is seen by more U.S. television viewers on a daily basis than any other individual. Since taking over as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News in 2004, he has strengthened the broadcast's position as the most-watched newscast in all of television and has become the most highly decorated evening news anchor of the modern era. He has received eleven Edward R. Murrow Awards, twelve Emmy Awards, the duPont-Columbia University Award, the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism and the industry’s highest honor, the George Foster Peabody Award.</p><p>Williams began his broadcasting career in 1981 at KOAM-TV in Pittsburg, Kan. He worked at several local stations in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City before joining NBC News in 1993. He became NBC’s chief White House correspondent and then anchor and managing editor of \"The News With Brian Williams\" on MSNBC and CNBC. </p><p>In 2004, he took over as anchor of \"NBC Nightly News,\" the nation’s top-rated nightly news program, a distinction it has maintained throughout Williams’ tenure in the anchor chair. Two years later, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. </p><p>In 2011, NBC News launched \"Rock Center with Brian Williams,\" the network’s first new primetime newsmagazine in nearly two decades. </p><p>Williams’ coverage of world events has earned him high praise and several citations for journalistic excellence, many of which were awarded for his work covering Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. The New York Tims said his reporting of Katrina was “a defining moment,” and Vanity Fair later called his work “Murrow-worthy” and reported that during the crisis he became “a nation’s anchor.” He has covered numerous presidential campaigns, nominating conventions, and elections, and has moderated eight presidential debates. </p><p>Williams is a native of Middletown, N.J. where he was a firefighter for several years. Before his start in broadcasting, Williams worked in the White House during the Carter administration, beginning as an intern. He later worked as assistant administrator of the political action committee of the National Association of Broadcasters in Washington. He attended Brookdale Community College, Catholic University and George Washington University, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation.</p>",

            "bio": "<p>Richard Engel is widely regarded as one of America’s leading foreign correspondents for his coverage of wars, revolutions and political transitions around the world over the last 15 years. Most recently, he was recognized for his outstanding reporting on the 2011 revolution in Egypt, the conflict in Libya and unrest throughout the Arab world.</p><p>Engel was named chief foreign correspondent of NBC News in April 2008. His reports appear on all platforms of NBC News, including “Nightly News with Brian Williams,” “TODAY,” “Meet the Press,” “Dateline,” MSNBC, and NBCNews.com.</p><p>Engel, one of the only western journalists to cover the entire war in Iraq, joined NBC News in May 2003. He previously worked as a freelance journalist for ABC News, most notably during the initial U.S. invasion of Iraq. He remained in Baghdad as NBC's primary Iraq correspondent until his appointment as senior Middle East correspondent and Beirut bureau chief in May 2006. Engel also covered the war between Israel and Hezbollah in the summer of 2006 from Beirut and southern Lebanon.  </p><p>Prior to working for ABC News, Engel served as the Middle East correspondent for \"The World,\" a joint production of BBC World Service, Public Radio International (PRI) and WGBH-Boston radio from 2001-2003. He has also written for USA Today, Reuters, AFP and Jane's Defense Weekly, a British publication in which he authored the magazine's in-depth profiles of Egypt, Yemen and al-Qaida.</p><p>Engel’s work has received numerous awards, including seven News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards.  In 2011, he was honored with the Daniel Pearl Award, the David Bloom Award and the Overseas Press Club Award in recognition of his coverage of the war in Afghanistan.  In 2010, Engel received a Gracie Award for his work on “Unlikely Refugees,” a “Nightly News” story about Afghan women who are treated as criminals for attempting to leave abusive marriages. Engel was honored in 2009 with the George Foster Peabody Award, an Edward R. Murrow Award and the Society of Professional Journalism Award for “Tip of the Spear,” a series of reports from Afghanistan that focused attention on the hardships and dangers faced by American soldiers. Engel also received the 2008 Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award and the Medill Medal for Courage in Journalism, the first ever given to a broadcast journalist, for his report \"War Zone Diary.\" The one-hour documentary, compiled from Engel's personal video journal, gave a rare and intimate account of the everyday realties of covering the war in Iraq. In 2006, Engel received the Edward R. Murrow Award for his report \"Baghdad E.R.,\" the first ever to win in the category \"Feature – Hard News.\"</p><p>Engel has lived in the Middle East since graduating from Stanford University in 1996 with a B.A. in international relations. He speaks and reads fluent Arabic, which he learned while living in Cairo. Engel has also traveled extensively in the Middle East and can comfortably transition between several Arabic dialects spoken across the Arab world. He is also fluent in Italian and Spanish. He is the author of two books, “A Fist in the Hornet’s Nest” and “War Journal: My Five Years in Iraq,” which chronicle his experiences covering the Iraq war.</p><p> </p>",

The Arizona Supreme Court said it would consider whether he received inadequate legal representation at his sentencing.
